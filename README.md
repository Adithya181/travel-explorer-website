The Travel Explorer Website is a single-page application (SPA) designed to simplify and accelerate the initial trip planning phase. It provides a clean, unified interface for users to search for any global destination and instantly consolidate three key pieces of information: location on an interactive map, real-time weather, and high-quality destination photos.

This project demonstrates strong skills in modern frontend architecture, API integration, and dynamic, user-centric design.
